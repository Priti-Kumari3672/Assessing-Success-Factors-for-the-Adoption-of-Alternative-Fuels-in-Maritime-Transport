# Assessing-Success-Factors-for-the-Adoption-of-Alternative-Fuels-in-Maritime-Transport
This project explores what drives the use of alternative fuels in maritime transport, focusing on factors like cost, regulations, social acceptance, and tech advancements. Using ENTROPY and ARAS methods, it assesses environmental impact, policy effects, and economic viability for fuels like hydrogen, LNG, and biofuels in the shipping industry.
# Purpose
The purpose of this study is to evaluate drivers for alternative fuel adoption in maritime transport. By exploring economic, regulatory, and social factors, the study aims to support policymakers and stakeholders in making informed decisions that align with global environmental and sustainability goals.
# Research Questions
1. What are the primary success factors influencing the adoption of alternative fuels in maritime transport?
2. What are the main barriers (e.g., technological, economic, regulatory) hindering the adoption?
3. How can these findings aid the industry's transition toward sustainable fuel use?
# Methodology
This study applied the ENTROPY and ARAS multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to assess factors from a comprehensive data set, including literature review, surveys, case studies, and data from maritime databases.
# Key Findings
* Technological Advancements: Adoption is linked to the compatibility of new fuels with existing infrastructure.
* Economic Feasibility: Cost competitiveness and financial incentives are crucial for stakeholder adoption.
* Regulatory Support: Policies like the IMOâ€™s 2020 Sulfur Cap drive the need for alternative fuels.
* Social Influence: Public awareness and industry collaboration are essential for broader adoption.
# Conclusion
This study highlights that a collaborative approach integrating technological innovation, economic feasibility, regulatory backing, and social engagement is essential for the successful adoption of alternative fuels in maritime transport. This research provides practical insights that can guide sustainable practices within the industry.
# Benefits
1. Environmental Impact: Reduces emissions, aligning with global decarbonization goals.
2. Economic Benefits: Financial incentives and lower long-term costs enhance feasibility.
3. Industry Sustainability: Supports the maritime sector's shift toward sustainable energy sources.
